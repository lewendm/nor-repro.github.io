# **Welcome to Norway's Reproducibility Network!**

Norwegian Reproducibility Network (NORRN) is a peer-led consortium located in Norway. It follows an organisational format adopted internationally as nationwide [“Reproducibility Networks”](https://www.ukrn.org/international-networks/). NORRN collaborates with the other Reproducibility Networks whilst remaining a unique and independent community.

## **Our mission**

NORRN aims to promote and enable rigorous, robust and transparent research practices in Norway. We attempt to achieve this goal by establishing appropriate training activities, designing, and evaluating research improvement efforts, disseminating best practices, and working with stakeholders to ensure coordination of efforts across the sector. NORRN’s activities span multiple levels, including researchers, librarians, institutions, and other stakeholders (e.g., funders and public authorities).  

Please review our [**Terms of Reference**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14Cn0wDbkjkLmqEGo6KBzLTOTr9nWCJ6GwFgz_bT5bX4/edit?usp=sharing) and [**Code of Conduct**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yf0Dng1yGO--nQFygjt-bRJ-SdDYLCRAKVWIeYf_D1o/edit?usp=sharing).
